### **ExtractAndOrganizeZips.ps1 - README**

This PowerShell script extracts all ZIP files from a specified source directory and places the extracted content in a new directory. The new directory name is generated by appending `-Extracted` to the source directory's name.

#### **How to Use**
1. **Edit the Script:**
   - Open `ExtractAndOrganizeZips.ps1` in a text editor.
   - Find the line containing the `sourceDir` variable:
     ```powershell
     $sourceDir = "C:\Path\To\Your\ZIPFiles"  # Placeholder: Change this to the path containing your ZIP files
     ```
   - Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\ZIPFiles"` with the path to the folder containing the ZIP files you want to extract.
   
2. **Automatic Directory Creation:**
   - The script will automatically create a new directory by appending `-Extracted` to the name of the `sourceDir`.
   - For example, if `sourceDir` is `C:\Users\John\Downloads\Zips`, the extracted files will be placed in a directory named `C:\Users\John\Downloads\Zips-Extracted`.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Open PowerShell, navigate to the directory where `ExtractAndOrganizeZips.ps1` is saved, and run:
     ```powershell
     .\ExtractAndOrganizeZips.ps1
     ```

#### **Script Overview**
- **sourceDir:** Specifies the folder containing the ZIP files to be extracted.
- **tempExtractDir:** Automatically created by appending `-Extracted` to `sourceDir`.
- **New-Item:** Creates the extraction directory.
- **Expand-Archive:** Extracts each ZIP file to the newly created directory.

#### **Example**
```powershell
# Define paths
$sourceDir = "C:\Users\John\Downloads\MyZips"  # Change this to your ZIP files directory
$tempExtractDir = "$sourceDir-Extracted"  # Extraction directory automatically created
```

#### **Notes**
- Ensure that the paths used do not contain invalid characters and that you have appropriate permissions to read the ZIP files and create new folders.
- Modify the script as needed to fit your specific use case.
